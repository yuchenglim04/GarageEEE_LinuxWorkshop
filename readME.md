Install WSL and run.



Always verify.
Verify creation or removal of files or directories:
```
ls
```

Verify you are at the right location:
```
pwd
```

Make sure you are in home
```
pwd
cd
pwd
ls
```

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yuchenglim04/GarageEEE_LinuxWorkshop.git
```
Verify cloning, check contents, then print out the cheatsheet. Good luck! 
```
ls
cd Garage*
ls
cat *filesystem*
```

Familiarising yourself with the linux subsystem, starting from home. Notice the hidden files (those that start with dot, the color coding for folders vs files)
```
cd
ls
ls -a
ls -af
ls -l
l-al
```

Go to root
```
cd /
ls
cd bin
ls
ls grep
ls | grep grep
```

Go back to home. Try to create and remove files. Always verify after each step.
```
vi iLikeKen
!wq
ls

mkdir YiRui_folder
ls

rmdir YiRui_folder
ls

rm iLikeKen
ls
```



From now on, try every command in the cheatsheet. Just be careful whether it applies to files or folders. hahahaha. There's no better way to learn. Anyway.
