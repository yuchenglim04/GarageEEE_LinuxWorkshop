You don't have to follow step by step. You get the gist of it, then you try out the commands in the cheatsheet. The goal is to try out the commands. If you want to try them in different ways, go ahead!


# Exploring the Filesystem

Where are you right now?  
Directly jump to root.  
Directly jump to home.  

Without teleporting...., open up the folders one by one:  
From home, go to root.  
From root, go to home.  

Go home  
list files.  
List all files, including hidden ones. What do you see?  


# Opening files
Clone this Github repository    
Go into the folder  
cat a file you like (perhaps this cheatsheet)  
tail  

blah  
blah  
blah  

# Installing packages 

# Compiling C, C++ code

# Automation: super basic scripting

to run the script, 

```
./name_of_script
```

Wait, you need to change mode first!

```
chmod blah blah blah
```
