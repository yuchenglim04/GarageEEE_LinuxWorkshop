You don't have to follow step by step. You get the gist of it, then you try out the commands in the cheatsheet. The goal is to try out all the commands. If you want to try them in different ways, go ahead!

Actually, it is very time consuming to write these exercises for someone. Supposedly, the student comes up with his own exercises on the fly and try out different things. Anyway. Notice how this exercises isn't really step by step. Instead, there is a lot of exploration (you realize something is missing etc).... Essentially this is what goes on in our heads when we do Linux, but fairly subconsciously. Learning is nonlinear!


# Exploring the Filesystem

Where are you right now?  
Directly jump to root.  
Directly jump to home.  

Without teleporting...., open up the folders one by one:  
From home, go to root.  
From root, go to home.  

Go home  
list files.  
List all files, including hidden ones. What do you see?  


# Opening files: Clone this repo!
Clone this Github repository    
```
git clone https://github.com/yuchenglim04/GarageEEE_LinuxWorkshop.git
```

Go into the folder  
cat a file you like (perhaps this cheatsheet)  
tail  

blah  
blah  
blah  


# Automation: super basic scripting
Go to the script folder. What are the files there? Try to see what's inside!  
try to run the script file. Does it work?  
Make the script file executable. List all files again, and notice the color change.  
Run again.  

P.S. what does the script actually do? Verify that it works

# Installing packages 

# Compiling C, C++ code
